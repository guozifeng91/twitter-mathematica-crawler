 crawling tweets using mathematica 12
 <br>
 <br>
this crawler downloads tweets without using the ServiceConnect function of mathematica, it relies on WebExecute (a new feature introduced in version 12) to crawl data from twitter.com/search by web browser automation. therefore it bypasses the speed limit of ServiceConnect (10s / call) and does not require a twitter account.
